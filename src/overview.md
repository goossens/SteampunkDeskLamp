This a rather simple Steampunk project. You buy some parts at the
hardware store, shop a little on [Etsy](http://etsy.com),
[Banggoods](http://bangoods.com) and/or [Ebay](http://ebay.com),
wire up some cables and LEDs, print some 3D parts and put it all
together. OK, I admit, that's a lot of work and it took me a few
months of figuring out how other people do this and than I had to
determine what the best options were for my skillset.

In the end, you can create a functional desk lamp with that old
Steampunk feel. The lamp only has three controls. A master power
switch implemented in the water valve, a dimmer in the bottom left
part of the case to control the Edison LED light bulb (yes, they
can be blinding even at 7 watts) and a power switch on the right
side of the case to turn the vacuum tube LED lights on and off.
So no matter what the bottom two controls are set to, the master
switch overrides them. This allows you for instance to preset the
dimmer to the right brightness and every time you rotate the water
valve, your light comes back to the same setting. The volt meter
in the middle of the case is functional and measures the voltage
for the vacuum tube LEDs. Below are some more pictures from different
angles. By clicking on a picture, you can zoom in and out.
