The beauty of these steampunk projects is that you can build them
a thousand different way. Here are the parts I used:

##### Edison LED Stand with Water Valve Switch

| Item | Description | Picture |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Mounting Flange | I used a 3/4" Black Iron Floor Flange that you can buy at any hardware store in the plumbing department. | [![P](img/flange2.jpg)](img/flange.jpg) |
| Black Steel Nipples | Three 3/4 inch Black Steel Nipple. I used two 4-1/2" and one 2". I got mine at Home Depot since theirs are a little "prettier" than the ones from Lowes. Remember we're after looks, not the ability to safely carry gas. | [![P](img/nipple2.jpg)](img/nipple.jpg) |
| Elbow | One 3/4" Black Iron 90Â° Elbow. | [![P](img/elbow2.jpg)](img/elbow.jpg) |
| Valve Switch | As this was my first Steampunk project, I bought a ready-made Water Valve Light Switch on Etsy. In the future, I'll make them myself by using a real water valve and adding a rotary switch. There are plenty of videos on YouTube on how to do this. | [![P](img/valve2.jpg)](img/valve.jpg) |
| Lamp Socket | Again I bought one ready-made on Etsy but these are equally easy to make by combining a Black Iron Elbow or Coupler and glueing in a rubber lamp socket. Both are available at the hardware store. | [![P](img/socket2.jpg)](img/socket.jpg) |
| Edison Light Bulb | This again is all about being pretty. I got a spherical LED Edison light bulb with a spiral filament that is 3" in diameter. Shop around and you can find them in many shapes. I would recommend you stick with LED as the incandescent Edison bulbs get incredibly hot. | [![P](img/bulb2.jpg)](img/bulb.jpg) |

##### Vacuum Tubes on Copper Pipes

| Item | Description | Picture |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Copper Fittings | I got two 3/4" Copper Threaded Adapter Fittings. The thread is the same 3/4" tapered [National Pipe Thread (NPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_pipe_thread) used on the Black Steel Nipples. This allowed the same 3D printed adaptors to be used. | [![P](img/copper2.jpg)](img/copper.jpg) |
| Vacuum Tubes | Given that we only use the vacuum tubes for looks, I got a box full of them on Ebay and I simply used the ones that looked the best and fitted in the base. Here I used two small ones. | [![P](img/tube2.jpg)](img/tube.jpg)
| LEDs | Four 5mm amber LEDS to bottom light the vacuum tubes (two LEDs per tube). I bought mine with a flat top so it was easier to glue them in. | [![P](img/leds2.jpg)](img/leds.jpg) |
| Resistors | Four 120 Ohm resistors for the LEDs. My LEDs were 2 volts. If you get a different voltage, the value of the resistor has to be adjusted. There are plenty of calculators for this on the Internet. | [![P](img/resistors2.jpg)](img/resistors.jpg) |

##### Vacuum Tube on the Right

| Item | Description | Picture |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Mounting Flange | I used the same 3/4" Black Iron Floor Flange mentioned above. | [![P](img/flange2.jpg)](img/flange.jpg) |
| Nipple | I used one 2" long Black Steel Nipple but you can use any size based on the geometry of your lamp. | [![P](img/nipple2.jpg)](img/nipple.jpg) |
| Reducing Coupling | One 1-1/4" x 3/4" Black Pipe Reducing Coupling. | [![P](img/reducer2.jpg)](img/reducer.jpg) |
| Vacuum Tube | From the same box mentioned above but I used a bigger one because it looked better. | [![P](img/tube2.jpg)](img/tube.jpg)
| LEDs | Two 5mm amber LEDS to bottom light the vacuum tube. | [![P](img/leds2.jpg)](img/leds.jpg) |
| Resistors | two 120 Ohm resistors for the LEDs. | [![P](img/resistors2.jpg)](img/resistors.jpg) |

##### Strange Coil Contraption in the Back

| Item | Description | Picture |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Coupler | Two 3/4" x 3/4" diameter Black Iron Coupling Fittings. |  [![P](img/coupler2.jpg)](img/coupler.jpg) |
| Washers | Four 1-1/4" washers with 1/4" holes. | [![P](img/washer2.jpg)](img/washer.jpg) |
| Spacers | 1/2" and 1" spacers. | [![P](img/spacer2.jpg)](img/spacer.jpg) |
| Screws | One 4" machine screw with nut. | [![P](img/screw2.jpg)](img/screw.jpg) |
| Wire | One foot of copper wire to create the coil. I used grounding wire which is sold in various thicknesses by the foot. You can also use a single strand extracted from a romex cable. | [![P](img/wire2.jpg)](img/wire.jpg) |

##### The Case

| Item | Description | Picture |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Copper Box | I used an antique copper planter box that I got from a craft store. I guess it was a one off as I can't find it anymore. The good news is that there are plenty available in different shapes and sizes. You can even use a plastic or wooden box and "patina it up" yourself. | [![P](img/box2.jpg)](img/box.jpg) |
| Dimmer | One 120 volt Rotary Base Dimmer. Mine is 300 watts but given that the Edison LED bulb only uses 7 watts, any dimmer will probably do. | [![P](img/dimmer2.jpg)](img/dimmer.jpg) |
| Volt Meter | One 10v DC panel mount meter. You can find plenty of these on Ebay and Banggoods. Pick your favorite shape. | [![P](img/meter2.jpg)](img/meter.jpg) |
| Switch | One good looking panel mount switch with cover. We're only switching 5v to the LEDs so it can be almost anything. | [![P](img/switch2.jpg)](img/switch.jpg) |
| Transformer | One 120 volt AC to 5 volt DC transformer. I used the Mean Well APV-8-5. | [![P](img/transformer2.jpg)](img/transformer.jpg) |
| Grommet | Given that the case is metal, I used a 3D printed grommet to protect the cable. A rubber grommet of the right size would also work. | [![P](img/grommet2.jpg)](img/grommet.jpg) |
| Plug | One 15-amp 125-volt NEMA 5-15 grounded power plug. I decided to go with grounded as the desk lamp has plenty of exposed metal. By grounding the chassis, accidents can be avoided. | [![P](img/plug2.jpg)](img/plug.jpg) |

Once we put it all together, we will also need some wire, wire nuts, solder,
shrink wrap, screws, bolts, nuts, scraps of wood, paint and glue.
These are all described in the instructions below.
