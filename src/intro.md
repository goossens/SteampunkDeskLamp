Welcome to my first [Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk)
project. I got interested in this artform in 2019 after I saw some amazing
projects on YouTube (see [links](#links) below for examples). Initially,
I wanted to try this out myself but I was quickly discouraged as most of
the Steampunk artists were experts in metalworking and machining. For a
second, I though I could pull this off using simple woodworking techniques
but that was never going to work with my skill level.
A renewed interest was developed when I got into 3D printing which made it
possible to manufacture the required parts using plastic.

One of my other hobbies is cooking and I've always liked the idea of
confusion cuisine where elements of different cultures are brought
together (e.g. Thai Chicken Lasagna). To me, Steampunk is the engineering
equivalent of this idea whereby you take things that don't belong together
and still make something functional and cool looking out of them.

On this page you can find a [description](#description) with pictures,
[instructions](#instructions) on how to make the desk lamp, [parts](#parts)
lists on what to buy, [schematics](#schematic) on how to wire it all up and
the 3D printed [models](#models) to 'glue' it all together. All digital
assets required to build your own can be found in my
[Github repository](https://github.com/goossens/DeskLight).
